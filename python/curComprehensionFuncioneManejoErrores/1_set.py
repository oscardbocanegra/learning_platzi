#On the following code we will se what is sets and how it works, 
#so the way to defined a set is with this brackets, and if we have
#any repetitive element the set is going to delete that repetitive รง
#element on the moment to print it

set_countries = {"Col", "Arg", "Bra", "Col"}
print(set_countries)

#And it is possible as well create a set with differents types
