# Exploratory Data Analysis with Palmer Penguins Dataset

This project contains an exploratory data analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset, a popular dataset used for data science and machine learning education. The analysis is performed using Python and various data science libraries.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding the characteristics and relationships between different penguin species (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap) using various statistical and visualization techniques.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Key Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy
  - statsmodels
  - sklearn
  - empiricaldist
  - janitor
  - palmerpenguins

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or higher)
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels scikit-learn empiricaldist pyjanitor palmerpenguins
   ```
3. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open `01_start.ipynb` to begin exploring the analysis

## Notebook Structure

The notebook (`01_start.ipynb`) contains:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical analysis
